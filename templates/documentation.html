        <h2>What is this app?</h2>
        <p>This app helps you find the best way to distribute your athlete's points in Summer Grepolympia events for optimal results. It uses real event data and machine learning to suggest the best attribute allocation for maximum score.</p>
        <h2>How to use the app</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Select event:</strong> Choose the Summer Grepolympia event you want to optimize for from the dropdown menu.</li>
            <li><strong>Enter athlete level:</strong> Input the number of points you have available to distribute among the attributes.</li>
            <li><strong>Click "Calculate Optimal Distribution":</strong> The app will show you the best way to allocate your points for the highest estimated score.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>What do the fields mean?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Select event:</strong> The specific Summer Grepolympia event (e.g., Hoplite Race, Archery).</li>
            <li><strong>Athlete level:</strong> The total number of points you can distribute among the three attributes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Understanding the results</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Best Distribution:</strong> The recommended number of points to assign to each attribute.</li>
            <li><strong>Estimated score:</strong> The score you are likely to achieve with this distribution. (This needs a bit more data to be accurate)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How does the prediction algorithm work?</h2>
        <p>The app uses a smart model selection process to give you the best possible predictions:
            <ul>
                <li>The event data is split into 70% for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing.</li>
                <li>Two models are trained: a <strong>Random Forest</strong> and a <strong>Polynomial Regression</strong> (degree 2).</li>
                <li>The model that performs best on the validation set is automatically chosen for predictions.</li>
                <li>For athlete levels within the data range, predictions are highly accurate (the app has seen these cases before).</li>
                <li>If you enter a level higher than the available data, the app will show a warning and do its best to extrapolate, but results may be less reliable.</li>
            </ul>
            This approach ensures you get the most accurate and robust predictions possible, using both machine learning and careful model selection. If you have more event data that could improve the model, please contact me.

        </p>
        <h2>Tips & Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The app uses real event data and machine learning, but results are estimates and may not guarantee the absolute best score every time.</li>
            <li>Only the events listed in the dropdown are currently supported.(I'm working on adding more soon.)</li>
        </ul>
